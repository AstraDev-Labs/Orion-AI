# worker-src it falls back to default-src for both, which lacks `data:`.
# That broke two real things once the frontend was served as a proper
# production PWA build: an embedded data:-URI web font failed CSP and got
# blocked, and the service worker registration failed outright. img-src
# needs data:/blob: for the same reason (data-URI icons, blob-based
# screenshots/exports elsewhere in the app). connect-src explicitly lists
# local HTTP/WS ports since the frontend talks to the backend and Ollama
# on several of them.
